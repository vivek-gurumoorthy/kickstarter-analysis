### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   1) In the months of May, June, and July, the number of successful theater outcomes skyrockets, indicating that theater crowdfunding may be most    successful in the late spring and early summer. 
   2) Contrarily, in winter months such as December, January, and February, the number of successful campaigns is significanty reduced and a much larger proportion of failed theater outcomes appears, suggesting that winter months may be less than optimal for these crowdfunding efforts. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
